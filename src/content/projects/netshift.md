## Download
The latest release of NetShift is available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/ZentrixLabs/NetShift/releases).  
Download the `NetShiftInstaller.exe` file directly from GitHub Releases and run it as Administrator to install.

## Overview

NetShift is a Windows utility that simplifies switching IP settings on network adapters. It allows users to quickly toggle between static IP configurations and DHCP using predefined presets â€” ideal for environments where network settings frequently change.  
The app is designed to be **user-friendly**, **secure**, and **efficient**, minimizing user privilege requirements while maintaining robust functionality.

### Key Features
- **Preset Management**: Save, apply, and delete IP configuration presets.
- **DHCP Support**: Reset adapters to DHCP easily.
- **Network Adapter Detection**: Lists physical adapters (excludes Bluetooth adapters).
- **Registry Fallback**: Preconfigure IP settings when adapters are disconnected.
- **Service-Based Architecture**: A LocalSystem Windows service (NetShiftServiceCpp) handles privileged operations, installed via NetShiftServiceInstaller.
- **Installer**: Self-contained installer with .NET 8 Desktop Runtime handling.

## Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **Service runs as LocalSystem** | Local-only named pipe, input validation, and code signing. |
| **Code signing** | All binaries are signed via SSL.com cloud signing to preserve trust. |
| **User privilege model** | Main app runs standard user level (`asInvoker`), no UAC prompt. |
| **Log files** | Logs are stored under user-local AppData, access-controlled. |
| **Local network communication** | WCF NetNamedPipeBinding used, locked to localhost only. |

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 (x64) or later.
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime.

### Steps to Install
1. Download the latest `NetShiftInstaller.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/ZentrixLabs/NetShift/releases) page.
2. Run `NetShiftInstaller.exe` as Administrator.
3. Follow the installer prompts.

### Silent Install
For automated deployments:

```bash
NetShiftInstaller.exe /silent
```

---

## Usage
1. Launch NetShift from Start Menu or Desktop.
2. Select a network adapter.
3. Apply a preset or manually configure IP settings.
4. Click "Apply" or "Reset to DHCP."
5. Save new presets for quick switching.

## Building and Contributing

### Automated Build and Release

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically:
- Build the NetShift application (NetShiftMain), service (NetShiftServiceCpp), and installer helper (NetShiftServiceInstaller).
- Package the signed installer EXE using Inno Setup.
- Cloud sign all binaries using SSL.com eSigner.
- Publish new signed releases on GitHub.

The pipeline **only triggers** when:
- A version tag (e.g., v1.0.1) is pushed.

### Manual Local Build

If you want to build manually:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mainframe79/NetShift.git
cd NetShift
```

2. **Install Prerequisites**:
- Visual Studio with .NET desktop workload
- .NET desktop development workload (for NetShiftMain and NetShift.Models).
- Desktop development with C++ workload (for NetShiftServiceCpp and NetShiftServiceInstaller).

3. **Build Projects:**
- Open NetShift.sln in Visual Studio.
- Build the solution in Release|x64 configuration:
- - NetShiftMain (C# WPF app).
- - NetShiftServiceCpp (C++ service).
- - NetShiftServiceInstaller (C++ installer helper).

- The build outputs will be in:
- - NetShiftMain\bin\x64\Release\net8.0-windows\net8.0-windows\NetShiftMain.exe
- - NetShiftServiceCpp\x64\Release\NetShiftServiceCpp.exe
- - NetShiftServiceInstaller\x64\Release\NetShiftServiceInstaller.exe

**Build the Installer:**
Navigate to NetShiftSetup and run the Inno Setup compiler (ISCC.exe) on setup.iss:
```bash
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" NetShiftSetup\setup.iss /DMyAppVersion="1.0.0"
```
The installer (NetShiftInstaller.exe) will be generated in the artifacts directory.

4. **Test Installer**:

```bash
copy NetShift\artifacts\NetShiftInstaller.exe C:\Temp\
cd C:\Temp
NetShiftInstaller.exe
```

## How It Works

```text
User --> NetShiftMain.exe (runs as Standard User)
            |
            --> (Named Pipe Communication: \\.\pipe\NetShiftService)
                    --> NetShiftServiceCpp.exe (runs as LocalSystem)
                               |
                               --> Windows Networking Stack (Change IP / DHCP Settings)
```

- The user interacts with a normal UI without needing elevation.
- All privileged operations (IP reconfiguration, registry edits) happen securely through the service.
- The service is isolated, only accessible locally, and installed via NetShiftServiceInstaller.exe.
